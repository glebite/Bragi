# Bragi
A text parsing/highlighting tool - might be handy.  

Also, remember to test with:  
$ pytest -n 3 conftest.py test

## Introdution  
Overall, what I want is to be able to feed a spec guide to a pdf convertor, run it through
a tool, generate an html file filled with links, goodies, highlighting, backlinks, word cloud,
and possibly paragraph by paragraph sentiment analysis.  

## Steps  
1. prototype word cloud  
2. prototype acronym work  
3. prototype html generation (probably straight forward)  
4. look into local sentiment analysis  
5. look into highlighting  
6. auto linking/backlinks
